Player
- Rotate the player using A and D for left and right rotation.

- Use the W key to apply forward thrust in the direction the ship
is facing.

- Fire a bullet from the ship by pressing the space key.

- Your fuel and health gets used up depending on difficulty.

- Once you have no fuel you will no longer be able to fly.

- You can commit suicide in the case of having no fuel pressing 'K'.

- You receive damage from enemy bullets and speedy building collisions.

- You have a score that increases as you move along or kill enemies.

Enemies
- There are 3 types of enemies, one scrolls along, one goes up and down
and the other will stay in its position firing towards you at an offset.

- You can kill these enemies to gain points towards your overall score.

Buildings
- You can land on all the buildings provided you are upright and you 
don't land at a speed too fast.

- Some buildings are refuel buildings. These will refill your ammunition
and your fuel if you are below the capacity for either of those.

Pickups
- There is a chance that pickups will spawn slightly above the buildings.

- There are 3 types of pickups, one is a health pickup which heals 25 hp,
one is a bullet pickup that provides you with a few extra bullets and 
the last one is a shield that provides protection for a damage capacity 
or a 10 second timer where the shield will destroy itself.

Once you have died you will be taken to the high scores page and be informed
that you have died and you will be told your score and shown the high scores.

Have fun!
